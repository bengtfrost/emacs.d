Yes, on Guix System, the typical reason `~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf` is **write-protected** is because:

1. The file is **managed by your declarative system** (e.g. `home.scm`) and might be a **symlink to a read-only store path**.
2. Or it has been **manually copied** or generated by a tool like `guix home import`, which sometimes results in read-only files.

---

### âœ… **Workaround (temporary writeable config)**

You can do the following:

#### 1. **Move the read-only file and create a new writeable one**

```bash
mv ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf.bak
touch ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
```

Ensure it's writable:

```bash
chmod u+rw ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
```

Now, start `qt5ct` normally:

```bash
qt5ct
```

This time, it will **save the configuration** to the new `qt5ct.conf`.

---

### ðŸ§© Alternative: Run with temporary config location

If you don't want to move files around, you can **override the config location**:

```bash
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/qt5ct-test qt5ct
```

After changing settings, copy the generated file:

```bash
cp /tmp/qt5ct-test/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf ~/Downloads/
```

Then you can safely review it and import it into your `home.scm`.

---

### âœ… Final step: Integrate into `home.scm`

Once you're happy with the configuration, you can embed the file using:

```scheme
(home-environment
  ;; ...
  (files (list
          (home-file
           ".config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf"
           (local-file "./files/qt5ct.conf")))))
```

Just place your finalized `qt5ct.conf` into `./files/qt5ct.conf` in your dotfiles repository.

Let me know if you want help diffing the new vs old config or turning it into Guix declarative format.
